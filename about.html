            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Paniudto was born from a passion to showcase the rich culinary heritage of Cantilan, Surigao del Sur. 
                Our name, derived from the local term meaning "to dine" or "to feast," reflects our commitment to 
                providing not just a meal, but a complete dining experience that celebrates our local culture.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
                We are dedicated to elevating traditional Cantilan dishes while preserving their authentic flavors. 
                By working closely with local farmers, fishermen, and suppliers, we ensure that every ingredient 
                tells a story of our community's rich maritime and agricultural heritage.
            </p>

            <h3>Local Ingredients, Global Standards</h3>
            <p>
                Our menu features fresh seafood caught daily from the pristine waters surrounding Cantilan, 
                vegetables grown in the fertile soils of Surigao del Sur, and spices that have been used in 
                local cooking for generations. We believe in sustainable practices and supporting our local economy.
            </p>
